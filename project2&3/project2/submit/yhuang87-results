Four main test cases was used for the grading
The first test case is worth 30 points, the rest are worth 20 points each
The test cases are main.cpp, your answer is run.txt, and the expected output is out.txt.
Check MyBama for the updated score
A different set of test cases may be used to grade Project 3
if you have any question send me an email.
Thanks.
